```{r}
# load the SASmarkdown package
library(SASmarkdown)
# set up the options so that knit knows where you SAS executable is
# set the linesize to be easily readable on letter size paper, portrait
# and set the knitr options using opts_chunk$set().
saspath <- "C:/Program Files/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/sas.exe"
sasopts <- "-nosplash -linesize 75"
knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine="sashtml", engine.path=saspath,
engine.opts=sasopts, comment=NA)
# run these commands to convince yourself that
# within this knitr session the engine changed.
