There are three instances you can consider using package::function() rather than library(package) and then function():

1. If you want to use a function from a package while another package has a function
from the same name. Specifying package::function() eliminates any unexpected
conflicts.

2. If you only need one function from a package, and want to avoid any conflicts (see
above). You can skip library(package) entirely and just use package::function() or
rename the function to something else.

3. When developing packages, you need to use the :: operator for all functions that are
not base r.
